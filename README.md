# Product Preview Challenge

## Important

English is not my native language, so I had to resort to online translators like Google Translate and DeepL, sorry for any spelling mistakes.

## Challenge

Based on the product preview challenge from the [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), where he brings a photo of a perfume and the goal is to get as close as possible to the photos that have been sent and are in the design folder.

Based on the fact that the mobile would have a screen size of 375px and the desktop 1440px.

## Technologies

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS / SCSS
- Git

## Project

The project seems quite challenging at first, but I wanted to try something new and not do basic HTML and CSS, so I decided to put in SASS, to see how it worked and what its advantages were.

My biggest difficulty and that was not fixed because it would be out of the scope of the challenge was how to improve the screen between the mobile device and the desktop, it looks disproportional with the screen, I put this as a future task to be done and fixed.

I used things like the Flexbox to direct the fields the way I wanted and the transition to make the houver at the add to card button smoother.

I also did something really new for me, the concept of mobile first, I always did the opposite, first the desktop and then the mobile, but by doing this concept I realized that my code was better and easier to visualize in the long term, really an experience very good.

Below are the prints of the finished card.

## Screenshots

As I used the mobile first concept, I quickly finalized that part, I thought it was very similar to the proposal and even in a very cool style, I would certainly make cards that way in real projects due to the clean design and easy to convey the proposal that in this case is to sell the perfume.

Here things are a little complicated, I had to change the width of the body, card and button several times to find the ideal position that most resembled the proposal, I think it's a lack of experience on my part, but it was quite fun to go through so many different shapes.
